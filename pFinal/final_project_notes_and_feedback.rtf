Interested in what happens to creations when they are not being used for the purpose that inspired their creation.\

Melanie recommends Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace - has a video so compelling that once you start watching you can't stop, but simply wither and die.\
\
She suggests using my insight about changing perception of time as the basis for narrative exploration - who would be interested in generating something that is addictive and changes time perception (power/political/social dynamic)? Explore before and after - see how it was created but also what use it's put to later.\

Pato reminded of panoramic view of game levels in game magazines, which give a feeling of emptiness (since you see all and it's minus the enemies/inhabitants); also "in the dark"? where you can't see the room when it's dark but other people can (very Schroedinger - Or compared it to the fridge light); also }
